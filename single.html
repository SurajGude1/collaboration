                        <p>To understand Chatgpt, let us understand the basics of chatbot. Chatbot is a platform
                            that
                            gives instant answers to questions asked by users, with the help of artificial
                            intelligence
                            and Natural Language Processing. The chatbots which are available in the market are also
                            called virtual assistance or virtual agents! Like when you visit the website of any
                            company,
                            you would have seen an icon like messenger, which provides assistance virtually!</p>

                        <p>In 1966 First chatbot was created by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum whose name
                            was
                            ELIZA.
                            Historically, the earlier chatbots used to answer only a limited set of queries. The
                            main
                            focus of the developers was to set only a limited set of queries. If the complexity of
                            the
                            queries was increased, then the earlier chatbots did not work so efficiently!
                            But as innovation started happening in AI, advanced level chatbots started being
                            created.</p>

                        <p> The initial version of chatgpt was released by San Francisco based company OpenAI on
                            November 30, 2022! ChatGPT crossed 1 million users in just 5 days! ChatGPT became one of
                            the
                            fastest growing platform which completed 1 million users in just 5 days!</p>


                        <p> It is not that there were no AI chatbots before chatgpt and many chatbots were announced
                            after the launch of ChatGPT! Now there are many alternatives to ChatGPT like:
                            1. Google Bard 2. Microsoft Bing Chat 3. Jasper.ai 4. Claude 5. ChatSonic 6. NeevaAI 7.
                            YouChat 8. Perplexity 9. Character.AI 10. Elicit 11. Learnt.ai
                            There are many chatbots like these that work on ai model and even Instagram has
                            announced
                            its own ai ChatBot!</p>


                        <p> Hope, all of you must have used chatgpt once, I have done it many times!
                            When I was preparing for campus placement, I liked coding but I was not expert enough to
                            solve complex or advance level problems, so we used to take help from those who knew
                            coding
                            well or sometimes from blackbox. Used to generate code. But after the advent of chatgpt,
                            I
                            have seen many such students who, if any problem is not being solved, are generating
                            code
                            directly from chatgpt with detailed solution. Students can learn coding comfortably
                            without
                            any help and companies' coding assessments too!</p>

                        <p> After the launch of ChagPT, many people told its positive and negative impact! Debates
                            and
                            new research studies also started happening on ChatGPT! To understand ChatGPT in depth,
                            one
                            such research case study was conducted by Ahmed Tlili and his team! The main focus of
                            the
                            study was how ChatGPT can bring revolution in education! To get the final conclusion,
                            they
                            analyzed the data in 3 ways! As
                            1.social network analysis of tweets
                            2.content analysis of interviews
                            3.investigation of user experiences
                            Conclusion: Embrace the technology rather than banning it</p>

                        <p> Most important topic right now! What will happen to the jobs!
                            Ever since chatgpt has been launched, people are feeling that their jobs are not in
                            danger!
                            Especially the people of Software filed!</p>

                        <p>May the innovation of engineers not become costly for the engineers themselves!
                            Let's come to our main issue, whether automation of everything or introduction of new
                            apps
                            like ChatGPT will affect employment? If we look at the current ChatGPT, it is not
                            capable
                            enough to completely replace the jobs, jobs will definitely be reduced to some extent in
                            the
                            future! You have to think as an employee because if automation benefits the company,
                            then
                            they will definitely reduce the employees! Some companies have also integrated chatgpt
                            to
                            manage daily operations. And some companies have also forbidden employees to use
                            chatgpt!</p>

                        <p> The sooner the one who adopts new technologies will remain in the market! For example,
                            instead of hiring different frontend developer & backend developer, companies will hire
                            only
                            one full stack developer! Is ! It is not that the customers themselves start fulfilling
                            the
                            requirements by using chatgpt, the customers will first have to tell their requirements
                            to
                            the developer, the developer will convert those requirements into technical requirements
                            and
                            then go and prepare the final product. By the way, the developer is like a bridge
                            between a
                            customer and the final product!</p>

                        <p>
                            New technologies will not stop coming, it is better to keep upgrading yourself with
                            technologies! What is your opinion about chatgpt and jobs. Please tell in the comment
                            box.</p>
